# Trivia-Game

A minimalist quiz game implemented with GUI, made in C, using the ncurses library. I created two windows, one for menu display (with functions such as New Game, Resume, Exit) and one for the questions themselves. The windows are put in two panels, in order to cycle between them. The player can see in real time how many points he reached and there is also a mistake counter. The game ends when three mistakes are made.

Run using "make run" in terminal in a unix-like environment.
